My objective is to build a personal blog that talks about things that I find interesting (graphics, security and privacy). To acheive this goal I must learn the follwing topics: 
* CSS and HTML
* JavaScript
* Rust
* React
* Three.JS

## CSS & HTML
These two standard markup language would provide the tools to develop front-end application/websites.

## Projects
